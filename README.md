# README
This project required me to build a Smart Health Care-Patient Management  System (SHC-PMS). The required functionality of the system is to allow a doctor to add new patient records, these doctors will also be able to view, edit and delete these records. After each doctor has registered and logged in they can navigate to their profile page and edit their details or delete their account. Each doctor can print out a pdf report of patient details and they can also search patients based on condition and sort them by age. The system will display a pie chart of the conditions of each patient, and the custom gem functionality allows doctors to check the price of a visit based on the patient’s age. The UI design for the application was created using the Materialize gem and adhering to Nielsen’s Heuristics of UI. There is a match between the system and real world applications in term of language, UI design is consistent and provides a degree of user control and freedom. Users are aware of the system status and the site can be used after a minimal amount of training.
